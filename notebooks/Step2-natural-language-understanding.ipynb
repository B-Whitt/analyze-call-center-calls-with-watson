ETA here has scheduled in the late afternoon could we get a copy of this so that we can see maybe not today but I'd like to see the program I'd like very much for you like to see the program itself or any one of them say we we made a hundred programs for E. and the eastern educational network and then when the money ran out people in Boston and Pittsburgh and Chicago all came to the fore and said we've got to have more of this neighborhood expression of care and this is what this is what I give I give an expression of care every day to each child help him realize that he is unique I am the program by saying you've made this day a special day by day just you're being you there's no person in the whole world like you and I like you just the way you are and I feel that if we in public television can only make it clear that feeling our mention uncle and manageable we will have done a great service for mental health well I think that it's much more dramatic that two men could be working out their feelings of anger much more dramatic than showing something of gun fire I'm constantly concerned about what our children are seen and for fifteen years I have tried in this country and Canada to present what I feel is a meaningful expression of care do you have an a rating I'm a hoax yes and I do all the pop ups and I write all the music and I write all the screen I'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy in this the first time I've had goose bumps for the last two days well I'm grateful not only for your goose bumps but for your interests in in our kind of communication could I tell you the words of one of the songs which I feel is very important is this has to do with that good feeling of control which I feel that the children need to know it's there and it starts out what do you do with the man that you feel and that first line came straight from a child I work with children doing pop ups in in very personal communication with small groups what do you do with the mad that you feel when you feel so mad you could buy when the whole wide world seems oh so wrong and nothing you do seems very right what do you do do you hunt your bag D. a pound some clay or some dough do you round up friends for a game of tag or see how fast you go it's great to be able to stop when you plan the thing that's wrong and be able to do something else instead and think this song I can stop when I want to can stop when I wish can stop stop stop anytime and what a good feeling to feel like this and know that the feeling is really mine know that there's something deep inside that helps us become what we can for a girl can be some day a lady and the boy can be some day a man I think it's wonderful I think it's wonderful %HESITATION looks like you just in the twenty million dollars \nlabel:  /family and parenting/children , score:  0.218487\nlabel:  /business and industrial , score:  0.08215\nlabel:  /art and entertainment/movies and tv/television , score:  0.0816767\n"
