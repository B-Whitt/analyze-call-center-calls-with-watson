The Notebook and information here seek to help organizations beginning to explore how to better understand the unstructured \"dark data\" that arises from phone calls to call centers. \n\n### Why is this useful?\nEnterprises spend more than $1 trillion on 250 billion customer service calls each year.  By using multiple IBM Watson \"signal services\" to extract signal from raw audio data; perform data analytics, clustering, unsupervised and machine learning, and visualizations, technical teams can use data understand patterns in call centers. KPI and ROI positive.\n\n### What is the process? And what Watson services are used?\nStep 1 - Speech to Text (STT) \u2013 Converts Raw Audio to Transcripts; \nStep 2 - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) - extracts features concepts, entities, keywords, categories/topics, sentiment and emotion; \nStep 3 - Natural Language Classifier (NLC) - is a user trained classification service, with user defined \u201cground truth\u201d that classifies text chunks; \nStep 4 - Tone Analyzer (Tone) \u2013 uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional and language tones in written text; \nStep 5 - Call Center Analytics \u2013 analyzes and visualizes the data signal to allow for interpretation of data and in cases, actionable insights; \n\n\n### Beginner Audience & Focus on Basics\n\u2022\tThis is a beginner lab intended to educate on the fundamentals of getting from data to insights with IBM Watson and open source tools \n\u2022\tAudience may include IT and operations teams curious about enriching unstructured data \u2013 the lab is NOT intended for sophisticated call center technologists \n\u2022\tLab/code does NOT purport to compete with expensive and sophisticated solutions already in market \n\u2022\tThe lab and code cover the basics \u2013 to educate on the fundamental plumbing and steps, to provide base for instrumentation \n\n### Success Metrics\nIf successful \u2013 the lab participants or notebook users will\n1.\tGain experience in using an IPython / Jupyter notebook\nhttps://ipython.org/notebook.html\n2.\tConnect to four Watson Developer Cloud \u2018signal service\u2019 APIs \nhttps://www.ibm.com/watson/developer/ \n3.\tConnect to IBM Cloud Object storage for data read and write \nhttps://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage \n4.\tUnderstand whether/how the tools and methods might benefit org\nhttps://github.com/mamoonraja/call-center-think18/tree/master/notebooks\n",
